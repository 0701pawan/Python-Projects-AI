# Python-Projects-Virtual Assistant
In this projects I have made a virtual assistant using python,
firstly it records the audio from system microphone and then covert that audio to text(string) and that text acts as a input to that program and then we can peform different operations depending upon the Input
# Packages

 speech recongnization:- Helps to convert your audio into text(It uses google speech recongnisation) you will also need to install pyaudio if you are using microphone
